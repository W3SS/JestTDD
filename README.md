About TDD

Baby steps, 1 test at a time Red - Green - Refactor. 

Different people will have different testing strategies based on this philosophy, but that seems reasonable 
to me given the immature state of understanding of how tests can best fit into the inner loop of coding. 

Whatever, don't go horse ... code it !
